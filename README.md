# GGP-Python code
Python version of the Generalized Geometry Projection Framework [1]. It includes as well a python version of the Method of Moving Asymptotes (MMA) optimization solver [2]. Four test cases are currently implemented in the provided python code: The MBB beam, the short cantiliever beam, the L-shape beam and a Wing Rib.

1. **Generalized_projection.py**: Python script that contains the main code.
2. **Generalized_projection.ipnyb**: Jupiter script containing runs for the different cases provided with their graphical solutions.
3. **MMA Solver Python**: Python translation of the Method of Moving Asymptotes (MMA) optimization solver [2].
